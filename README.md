# Puzzle Master (refactor)

This is a small Vite + React scaffold created from your original single-file component. I split the UI into reusable components for easier maintenance and to prepare for future API integration.

What's included
- `src/components/PuzzleWebsite.jsx` - main page composed from smaller components
- `src/components/Navbar.jsx` - header with category and dark mode controls
- `src/components/Hero.jsx` - hero section
- `src/components/PuzzleGrid.jsx` - grid + empty state handling
- `src/components/PuzzleCard.jsx` - individual puzzle card
- `src/components/Modal.jsx` - modal to reveal the answer
- `src/main.jsx`, `src/App.jsx` - app entry

Quick start (PowerShell)

```powershell
cd c:/education/ReactApp/IEEE
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes
- The original UI used Tailwind utility classes. I left the classes in place and added a small `src/styles.css` to make the layout readable without Tailwind. For full parity, install and configure Tailwind in this project (I can do that for you).
- To connect to an API later: replace `samplePuzzles` in `PuzzleWebsite.jsx` with fetched data (useEffect + fetch/axios) and add loading/error states.

Next steps I can do for you
- Configure Tailwind and match exact styling
- Replace sample data with an API client and add loading/error states
- Add unit tests for components
