# Puzzle Master (refactor)

This is a small Vite + React scaffold created from your original single-file component. I split the UI into reusable components for easier maintenance and to prepare for future API integration.

What's included

- `src/components/PuzzleWebsite.jsx` - main page composed from smaller components
- `src/components/Navbar.jsx` - header with category and dark mode controls
- `src/components/Hero.jsx` - hero section
- `src/components/PuzzleGrid.jsx` - grid + empty state handling
- `src/components/PuzzleCard.jsx` - individual puzzle card
- `src/components/Modal.jsx` - modal to reveal the answer
- `src/main.jsx`, `src/App.jsx` - app entry

Quick start (PowerShell)

```powershell
cd c:/education/ReactApp/IEEE
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes

- The original UI used Tailwind utility classes. I left the classes in place and added a small `src/styles.css` to make the layout readable without Tailwind. For full parity, install and configure Tailwind in this project (I can do that for you).
- To connect to an API later: replace `samplePuzzles` in `PuzzleWebsite.jsx` with fetched data (useEffect + fetch/axios) and add loading/error states.

Next steps I can do for you

- Configure Tailwind and match exact styling
- Replace sample data with an API client and add loading/error states
- Add unit tests for components

## Netlify build fix (2025-10-16)

Netlify failed to install due to an npm peer dependency conflict:

- `@react-three/drei@10.7.6` requires `react@^19`, while the app uses `react@18`.

Audit showed we were not importing `@react-three/drei`, `@react-three/fiber`, or `three` anywhere. To fix the build, we removed the unused 3D stack from `package.json` and kept React 18:

- Removed dependencies: `@react-three/drei`, `@react-three/fiber`, `three`.
- Verified locally with `npm ci` and `npm run build`.

If you plan to add 3D features later, you have two supported options:

1. Upgrade to React 19 and keep `@react-three/drei@^10`.
2. Keep React 18 and use a drei version that supports React 18 (pin to an earlier compatible release).

As a last resort for CI only, you can allow legacy peer deps during install:

```
npm ci --legacy-peer-deps
```

However, resolving versions in `package.json` is the recommended longâ€‘term fix.
